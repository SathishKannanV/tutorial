home.text.whatIs.pt1=The AEFW Kickstart 3.0.1. is a web project template and reference application \

created and managed jointly by Technology Enablement and Frameworks & Services.  Either team can \

perform some minimal, automated customization of \

the template to make it more appropriate for use on your project.  What this means is your RAD \

projects won't have generic names like <i>aefw-kickstart</i> and <i>aefw-kickstart-web</i> and your packages won't \

appear as <i>com.aetna.framework.kickstart</i>, instead, these details will be updated to more accurately \

represent your application.  For instance, Aetna Navigator might end up with RAD project names like \

<i>navigator</i> or <i>navigator-web</i> and package names beginning with <i>com.aetna.member.navigator</i>.



home.text.whatIs.pt2=Ok, so it's a customizable project template, but why use it?  Read on.

most skilled development team up to four weeks of effort.



home.text.benefits.pt2=You can think of the AEFW Kickstart 3.0.1. as a fully functional "shell" of an \
